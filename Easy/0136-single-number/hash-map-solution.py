    LeetCode 136 â€” Single Number

    Given a non-empty array of integers where every element appears twice except for one,
    this method finds and returns the element that appears only once.

    The algorithm uses a hash map (dictionary) to count the frequency of each number.

    Time Complexity: O(n)
    Space Complexity: O(n)

    Example:
        >>> solution = Solution()
        >>> solution.singleNumber([2, 2, 1])
        1
        >>> solution.singleNumber([4, 1, 2, 1, 2])
        4

            int: The unique element that appears only once.
