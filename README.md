# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) problems.  
Each solution is written in Python and organized by difficulty level (`easy`, `medium`, `hard`).  

---

- Each problem has its own folder: `problem-number-problem-name`.
- Inside each folder, there may be multiple solution files (`solution_hashmap.py`, `solution_math.py`).

---


## Goals

- Practice algorithmic thinking.
- Write clean, well-documented, and efficient Python solutions.
- Build a collection of solutions that are easy to navigate and learn from.

---

## Notes

- All solutions follow the **LeetCode format** (`class Solution:`).  
- Each file includes example runs under `if __name__ == "__main__":`.  
- Time and space complexities are documented in the code.
